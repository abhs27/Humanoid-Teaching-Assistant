3. **Format the prompts by replacing placeholders:**
   - {conversation_context}: Recent conversation history
   - {educational_content}: Retrieved RAG content
   - {question}: Student's question
   - {calculated_answer}: For math calculations only

4. **Prompt Selection Logic:**
   ```python
   if analysis["intent"] == "learn" and analysis["subject"] == "math":
       use MATH_LEARNING_PROMPT
   elif analysis["intent"] == "practice" and analysis["subject"] == "math":
       use MATH_PRACTICE_PROMPT
   elif analysis["intent"] == "learn" and analysis["subject"] == "reading":
       use ENGLISH_LEARNING_PROMPT
   elif analysis["intent"] == "practice" and analysis["subject"] == "reading":
       use ENGLISH_PRACTICE_PROMPT
   elif analysis["intent"] == "explore":
       use EXPLORATION_PROMPT
   elif simple_math_detected:
       use SIMPLE_MATH_PROMPT
   else:
       use GENERAL_CONVERSATION_PROMPT
   ```

5. **For Error Handling:**
   - Use ERROR_HANDLING_PROMPT when student input is unclear or system encounters issues

6. **Testing Your Prompts:**
   - Test with various student questions
   - Ensure responses are age-appropriate
